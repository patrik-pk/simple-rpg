In this game you can fight against 6 different species (aquatic, avians, dinosaurs, insect, wildlife and reptiles).
Color of the enemy is based on his specie. Meanwhile players color is based on his strongest bonus stat against certain specie.
You can find fight two types of weapons, melee and ranged. Each has 3 types of attack, light, medium and strong. Stronger attacks

## Inventory
In the Inventory you can buy items from shop, equip them and sell them. You can also sort your items and make your
inventory cleaner. In the top left corner you can see your level, progress bar, gold and also dices, which are used for
rolling the shop items and rolling the enemies in Classic Game. Dices are loaded up to 5 times in 15 seconds period. Maximum level is 30.
In the Inventory you can also see your stats and your equipped items. 
There are 12 types of items and 12 rarities. First 5 rarities can be found in the shop or after defeating Classic Enemy
(common, uncommon, rare, epic and legendary). The next 7 rarities can be obtained by either crafting or defeating a boss. 6 of them are
specie bonuses and give you big amount of only one type of bonus. The last rarity is mythic, which gives you bonuses against all the species
and is also the most difficult to obtain.

## Classic Game
There are two types of modes. Classic Game and Dungeon. In Classic Game you can choose to fight between 3 unique enemies that are
randomly generated. One is always one level lower than you, one is even and one is one level higher than you. You get reward based
on the difficulty of the enemy based on the level difference. If you win, you obtain two drops and one random item, along with plenty of
gold and experience. If you lose, you only get gold. You can re-roll enemies with dices.
